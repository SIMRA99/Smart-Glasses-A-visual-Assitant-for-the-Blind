A system to help the blind by utilizing computer vision using deep learning algorithms for object & face detection, speech recognition, OCR , text-to-speech and obstacle alert. It works on speech commands to detect the surrounding and convert it to voice via text to speech concept and to read texts . The project uses deep learning to give maximum accuracy while emphasis on cost effectiveness.
( Tech used: Deep learning algorithm, sensors, Wireless connectivity, Python , speech recognition, computer vision , text to speech)

Files:
mainfinal.py contains the object and face recogntion 
ultrasonic.py detects the distance from objects
OCR.py detects text in real -time and reads it out to the user. 
SPEECH.py takes in speech commands. 
up.py is wake word for the model. a tflite model has been trained for the work "up" to start the system. 


The system is attached to s jacket so that the user can easily carry the system without any interruption
